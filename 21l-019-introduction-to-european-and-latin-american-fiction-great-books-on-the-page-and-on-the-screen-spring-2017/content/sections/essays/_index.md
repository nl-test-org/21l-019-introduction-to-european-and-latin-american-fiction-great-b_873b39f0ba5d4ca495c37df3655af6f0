_Guidelines for all essays:_

*   Include a title and your name on a single line at the top of your essay.
*   Indent paragraphs; do not double space between paragraphs.
*   Double space between lines; use 1” margins all around.
*   Use Times or Times New Roman Font; 12 point.
*   Short essays should be between 3–3.5 pages.
*   The essay should have a good, strong arguable thesis.
*   Do not quote the prompt. A good strong thesis will signal to the reader which prompt you are answering.
